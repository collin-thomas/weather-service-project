# Weather Service Project

## Prompt

Write an http server that uses the Open Weather API that exposes an endpoint that takes in lat/long coordinates.

This endpoint should return what the weather condition is outside in that area (snow, rain, etc), whether itâ€™s hot, cold, or moderate outside (use your own discretion on what temperature equates to each type), and whether there are any weather alerts going on in that area, with what is going on if there is currently an active alert.

The API can be found here: <https://openweathermap.org/api>. The one-call api returns all of the data while the other apis are piece-mealed sections. You may also find the <https://openweathermap.org/faq> useful.

### Summary of Response

- Wether Condition (Snow, Rain, etc)
- Feels (Hot, Cold, Moderate)
- Wether alerts and description of each alert

## Usage

### Route Syntax

GET /weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&api_key={api_key}

## Test

```sh
npm test
```

```sh
npm run test:watch
```

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env` to create `.env.development` and `.env.production`. Then enter the `OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY`.

If we had CI/CD we would have the environment variables securely stored in the cloud and create the `.env.*` files are part of the pipeline.

## Build Locally

```sh
docker build --target development -t weather-service-project:1.0.0-development .
docker build --target production -t weather-service-project:1.0.0-production .
```

## Run

### Run Development

```sh
docker run \
    --rm \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    -p 9299:9299 \
    -v "`pwd`/app:/app" \
    --name weather-service-project \
    weather-service-project:1.0.0-development
```

### Run Production
